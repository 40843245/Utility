# NumberSplitter (1th version)
## Objective
Given a positive integer n. Get a list of number whose product is the maximum number and whose sum is n.

## Example
### Example 1 
#### Input
5 
#### Output
6
#### Explanation
Since 
      
      5 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1  => 1 * 1 * 1 * 1 * 1 = 1
      5 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 2  => 1 * 1 * 1 * 2 = 2
      5 = 1  + 2 + 2 => 1 * 2 * 2 = 4
      5 = 2 + 3  => 2 * 3 = 6
      ...

And the maximum product of a list of number, whose sum is equal to 5, is 6.

The answer is 6.

### Example 2
#### Input 
12
#### Output
81
#### Explanation

    12 = 4 + 4 + 4 => 4 * 4 * 4 = 64
    12 = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 => 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 81 
    ...

And the maximum product of a list of number, whose sum is equal to 12, is 81.

The answer is 81.

## Known issue
